# DEPRECATED

This library was made redundant with the introduction of [`purescript-profunctor`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-profunctor), as an `Arrow` is just a [`Strong`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-profunctor/1.0.0/docs/Data.Profunctor.Strong) [`Category`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/1.0.0/docs/Control.Category).

The most recent [v0.6.2 release](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-arrows/releases/tag/v0.6.2) will continue to work for older libraries that still depend on it, although is incompatible with PureScript 0.9 and newer.
